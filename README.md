## API Endpoints

### Core Endpoints

- `GET /` - API health check and system status
- `POST /generate_trajectory` - Generate optimized coverage trajectory for rectangular walls
- `POST /save_trajectory` - Save generated trajectory to database with metadata
- `GET /trajectories` - Retrieve stored trajectories with pagination and filtering
- `GET /trajectory/{id}` - Get specific trajectory by ID
- `DELETE /trajectory/{id}` - Delete trajectory by ID
- `GET /trajectory/search` - Search trajectories by criteria (dimensions, obstacles, etc.)
- `GET /trajectory/stats` - Get database statistics and analytics
- `GET /system_status` - System performance metrics and monitoring

### Execute Trajectory Endpoint

The `POST /execute_trajectory/{trajectory_id}` endpoint simulates the execution of a stored trajectory by the robot. When called, it:

- Retrieves the specified trajectory from the database.
- Starts a new execution session and logs the session.
- Publishes real-time status updates (start and completion) via the message broker.
- Simulates the robot's movement along the trajectory, logging each action in detail.
- Returns the session ID, execution status, trajectory ID, and the number of points executed.

**Data Storage:**

- Execution sessions and detailed robot actions are logged in the database (`robot_actions` table), including action type, parameters, timestamps, and status.
- Status messages are queued in the message broker for real-time monitoring.

**Example Usage:**

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/execute_trajectory/1"
```

### Database Schema

**Trajectories Table:**

- `id` - Primary key
- `wall_width` - Wall width in meters
- `wall_height` - Wall height in meters
- `obstacles` - JSON array of obstacles
- `trajectory_data` - JSON array of trajectory points
- `created_at` - Timestamp
- `execution_time` - Generation time
- `total_points` - Number of trajectory points

**System Logs Table:**

- `id` - Primary key
- `timestamp` - Log timestamp
- `level` - Log level (INFO, ERROR, etc.)
- `message` - Log message
- `request_id` - Associated request ID
- `execution_time` - Request execution time

**Robot Actions Table:**

- `id` - Primary key
- `trajectory_id` - Foreign key referencing trajectories table

- `parameters` - JSON object with action-specific parameters (e.g., coordinates, speed)
- `timestamp` - Action execution timestamp
- `status` - Action status (PENDING, COMPLETED, FAILED)

**Message Queue Table:**

## Coverage Planning Algorithm

The system implements a **boustrophedon (back-and-forth) coverage pattern** specifically designed for rectangular walls with rectangular obstacles:

### Core Algorithm Features:

- **Vertical Line Pattern**: Robot moves in alternating up-down passes across the wall width
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Intelligent navigation around rectangular windows and obstacles
- **Tool Overlap**: Configurable overlap between passes for complete coverage guarantee
- **Safety Margins**: Automatic safety buffer around all obstacles
- **Speed Optimization**: Variable speeds (0.1 m/s working, 0.15-0.2 m/s positioning)
- **Path Optimization**: Minimal trajectory points for smooth robot motion

### Algorithm Implementation:

1. **Grid-based Coverage**: Divides wall into tool-width vertical strips
2. **Obstacle Detection**: Identifies intersections with rectangular obstacles
3. **Safe Navigation**: Plans paths around obstacles with safety margins
4. **Tool State Management**: Activates/deactivates tool based on obstacle proximity
5. **Trajectory Generation**: Creates optimized point sequence with timing

## Logging & Monitoring

   - Detailed error tracking and debugging
   - Performance trend analysis

3. **Database Logging** (SQLite system_logs table):
